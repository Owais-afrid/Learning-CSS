<!-- This is "Flex property" and used one of the many properties which is "Flex Direction"
 First you use "Dispaly: Flex;" to arrange the elements in the same line just like "Inline-Block" and then we use "Flex Direction" to change its direction like by default alligned as "row" you use that property to "row reverse", "column", "column-reverse".  -->
