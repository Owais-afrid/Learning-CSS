<!-- This is "relative unit" basically changing the size through "px", "%", "em", "rem", "vh / vw" basically this is measured in the whole page like in the above "#first" i gave its height "80vh" so it takes the background color and takes the size of the 80% of the whole page and then "30vw" as width so it took only 30% width of the whole page.  -->
