<!-- This is "relative unit" like defininig the size in different units like "px", "%" and more etc and here i have used "%" and defined "second"  its size and this "percentage is realtive to its parent size to make it simpler, in the above i used 2 "div" tags and in the "#first" i gave height and width in "px" and so in "second" i used "%" and it divided the "%" from those "px" like if "100px" and gave "50%" it takes "50%" of "100px".-->
