<!-- This is "descendant selector" this here helps if you want that particular tag where you have used that same tag multiple times and while selecting the color for that tag it fills the color for every that particular tag you used multiple times so this comes in very handy so you define or give "id" to that particular one of that multiple time you used that tag and define both "parent" and "descendant" so that the color is filled to that particular one.  -->
