<!-- This is "class selector" attribute works same as "id selector" but also different from it as "id selector" should be unique and only able to use once but "class selector" should be same as it prioritizes for multiple heading or paragraphs etc and you can auto generate the "div" tag as same as "id" selector by using "." and defining the same "class_name" for "id selector" should be different as it should be unique.  -->
